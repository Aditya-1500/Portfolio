					"description": "Here, I worked on development of an Data Marketplace. The task to develop an easy to use User Interface consisting of APIs to access data and a backend to make required API Calls. The APIs used both REST and gRPC Services. I worked on the backend and using Go language, prepared the code to generate Swagger-UI for corresponding proto files for the gRPC Services. The client created using Golang could fetch the data from server in real-time and provide response to API Call. At the end of this internship, the swagger-ui was integrated with the main user interface created using ReactJs and the application was dockerized and deployed using OpenShift.",
